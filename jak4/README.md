# At the Ends of Eras
(formerly known as Jak 4)

Playable here: https://needleful.itch.io/ends-of-eras

This is an open world 3D platformer I've been working on since March 2022 for the Open World Jam.

## Building
This game requires a modifled version of Godot 3 available here: https://github.com/needleful/godot/tree/jackie_3.x.

It works on Windows, but I'm not sure if the build works on Linux anymore. Other platforms were either explicitely removed or probably broken.
