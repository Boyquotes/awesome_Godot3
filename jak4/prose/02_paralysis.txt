I could walk five thousand miles in any direction and dedicate my life to what I find along the way.
A straight line, no shortcuts, no detours, and I would live a vivid and complete life.
There are a billion such lines I could walk on the Earth, starting from any point and ending at any other, with enough sights and experiences to fill a thousand novels.
But I'm paralized by the bredth of choice. What if I choose wrong? What if there are more exciting lines to travel? What if I get hurt in my travels?
Suddenly, I'm 27 and I haven't taken a single step.
