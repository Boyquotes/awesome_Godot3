You have to accept that reality is a solid object. The past and the future exist just as much as north and south, and up and down. It's all laid out, like a beautiful tapestry.
The idea that the present changes the future is an illusion of the mind. We're only viewing a small part of the object, gradually pulled through the tapestry to watch the colors change.
It's hard for some people to get this part. It's why I start with it.
It doesn't mean nothing matters, or that you shouldn't do anything.
Some people are doomed to fight the fabric, trying to change what's happened or will happen.
The Hasyr. The Buule, the Vaelers. They tried to conquer this desert, and make it something it wasn't. In doing so, they were not just fighting the sand and heat, they were fighting causality itself.
We exist inside the fabric. We don't weave it. We are a part of it.
