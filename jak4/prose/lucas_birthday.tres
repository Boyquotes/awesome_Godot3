Twenty-two. How exciting. Or is it twenty-three now?
There aren't many big years left. Twenty-five if you enjoy maths, perhaps.
Thirty could be another, when Mother and Father hopefully stop asking me when I'll have
children.
Don't want any halfwits in the family tree, do we?
Any more off-colour fruit on this branch and we'll need a graft!

All the same, happy birthday.
Happy birthday to the light in Father's eyes.
Happy birthday to the fluttering of Mother's breast.
Happy birthday to the nausea I feel when I look at you."
