text = "As of late, I'm inflicted with a childhood memory every time I mention Lucas.
He was a baby at the time, so I must have been five or six years old. For some reason, Clarissa had left me in charge of him for a moment as she ran errands.
I absent-mindedly watched him crawl around in our room for a few minutes. I didn't care to play with him, no matter how much he grabbed at me.
I don't remember why, but I then took Lucas into our parents' bedroom, held him over my head, and set him on their dresser. I stepped back and watched him from the middle of the room.
He was dumb-founded for a moment. He grabbed at a clamshell mirror, then put it down. He moved to see down the side of the dresser, then pulled back in fear.
He looked at me and reached out his arms for me to bring him back down. I didn't move.
He started crying. I didn't move.
He got increasingly loud, screaming as he tried to get down on his own, dangling his feet over the edge only to pull them back.
It was probably just a few minutes before he quieted down, sobbing and staring at me from his perch.
Eventually I took him down and brought him back to our room.

I can recall childhood cruelties of all sorts. Sudden, unprovoked nastiness toward friends, schoolmates, and of course Lucas."
